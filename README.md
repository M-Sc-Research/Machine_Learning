Machine Learning, on the other hand, gives us the technology that allows us to automatically learn these complex rules efficiently from labeled examples, called, training data, in a way that is much more accurate and flexible than attempting to program all the rules by hand.

> There can be many different types of hacking or intrusion attempts to break into the server or exploit it in some way. We don't have reliable training labels that we could use to train the classifier using supervised learning. Instead, we need an unsupervised approach that allows us to perform something called outlier detection. That doesn't assume future attacks will be of the same form as previous attacks.

first talk about what it means to convert the problem into a representation that a computer can deal with. This involves two things. You need to convert each input object, which we often call a sample, into a set of features that describe the object. Second, we need to pick a learning model, typically the type of classifier that you want the system to learn.
